Python is a popular programming language. Its an easy to learn and powerful programing language. Its's elegant syntax and dynamic typing features, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

## **History of Python**

* **`Guido Van Rossum`** - Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 at CWI in the Netherlands
* **`Python 1.0`** - Python 1.0 was released on 1994, with new features like lambda, map filter and reduce operations
* **`Python 2.0`** - Python was released on 2000, with new features like garbage collector for memory management and support for unicode
* **`Python 3.0`** - Python was released on 2008 after long period of testing. It was designed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the older versions

## **Where we can use python?**

* **`AI and Machine Learning`** - Python is a perfect language for various machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence projects
* **`Web Development`** - Python can be used to create web applications. Django, Flask and Pyramid are the very famous python web development frameworks
* **`Data analytics and Visualization`** - Python provides a variety of graphing libraries to collect, manipulate, organize and visualize the data. It is another popular and vast developing area of interest
* **`Embedded systems`** - In python, we can write code to control hardware systems and robots. MicroPython, Raspberry Pi, PythonRobotics are the most famous library for home automation, IOT and robotics
* **`Automation`** - Python is beginner friendly to automate any tasks on the computer. The task which we are performing over and over again, can be automate more efficiently using python

## **Characteristics of Python**

* **`Interpreted language`** - Before execution, we are not required to compile the python program because it is processed at runtime by the interpreter
* **`Cross-platform language`** - Code Once Run Anywhere - Python is a portable language which equally runs on different platforms like windows, linux, macintosh etc.
* **`Object-Oriented language`** - Python supports all OOPS concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism etc. It helps to develop application with minimal and reusable code
* **`Free and Open-Source`** - Python is free and open-source which source code is available in public for download, use, modify and distribution
* **`Dynamically Typed`** - In Python, We don't need to declare the variable data type since interpreter automatically determine the data type ar run time based on the given expression
